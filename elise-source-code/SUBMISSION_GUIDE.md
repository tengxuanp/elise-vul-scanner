## üì¶ Files Ready for ChatGPT Submission

### 1. **ELISE_PROJECT_DESCRIPTION.md**
- **Purpose**: Comprehensive project overview and technical documentation
- **Size**: ~15KB
- **Content**: Complete architecture, workflow, API endpoints, ML system details

### 2. **elise-clean-source.zip**
- **Purpose**: Clean source code without unnecessary files
- **Size**: ~1.6MB
- **Content**: All source code, configuration files, and documentation
- **Excluded**: Cache files, logs, databases, virtual environments, node_modules

## üöÄ How to Submit to ChatGPT

### Option 1: Upload Both Files
1. Upload `ELISE_PROJECT_DESCRIPTION.md` as the main description
2. Upload `elise-clean-source.zip` as the source code
3. Use this prompt:

```
I'm sharing my Elise project - an advanced ML-powered web vulnerability scanner. 

Please read the ELISE_PROJECT_DESCRIPTION.md file first to understand the project architecture and workflow, then examine the source code in elise-clean-source.zip to understand the implementation details.

The project combines:
- Dynamic web crawling with Playwright
- ML-based vulnerability prediction (48 enhanced features)
- Intelligent payload recommendation
- CVSS-based severity assessment
- Full-stack architecture (Next.js frontend + FastAPI backend)

I'd like help with [your specific question/request here].
```

### Option 2: Copy Description + Upload Code
1. Copy the entire content of `ELISE_PROJECT_DESCRIPTION.md`
2. Upload `elise-clean-source.zip`
3. Use this prompt:

```
[Paste the entire ELISE_PROJECT_DESCRIPTION.md content here]

I've also uploaded the complete source code in elise-clean-source.zip. Please examine both the description and source code to understand my project.
