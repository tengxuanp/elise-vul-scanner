# Enhanced ML Fix Verification Guide

## What We Fixed
We identified and fixed the issue where `family_probs` was arriving as an empty object `{}` in the frontend, causing the UI to display "Heuristic" instead of real ML scores.

### Backend Fix Applied
In `/Users/raphaelpang/code/elise/backend/modules/fuzzer_core.py`:
- Added fallback logic: `chosen_family = fam or "sqli"`
- Ensured `family_probs` is always properly populated: `family_probs_dict = {chosen_family: 1.0}`
- Added debug logging to track metadata building process

### Frontend Enhancement (Previously Applied)
In `/Users/raphaelpang/code/elise/frontend/src/app/pages/CrawlAndFuzzPage.jsx`:
- Enhanced detection for Enhanced ML results
- Improved `hasRealMLData` logic to recognize enhanced ML even when `model_ids` is missing
- Added `_ml_type` field to distinguish "Enhanced ML" from regular "ML"

## Manual Verification Steps

### Step 1: Check Frontend UI
1. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser
2. Navigate to the "Crawl & Fuzz" page
3. Look for any existing results in the table

### Step 2: Test Enhanced ML with New Crawl
1. Enter a test URL: `http://testphp.vulnweb.com/artists.php?artist=1`
2. Run the crawl and fuzz operation
3. Look for the "Ranker" column in the results

### Step 3: What to Look For
**BEFORE FIX:** 
- Many results showing "Heuristic" in the Ranker column
- Some showing "Score: 0.050" (synthetic fallback scores)

**AFTER FIX:**
- Results should show "Enhanced ML" in the _ml_type column
- Real ML scores like "Score: 0.0499" or "Score: 0.0588"
- `family_probs` should contain actual values like `{sqli: 1.0}` instead of `{}`

### Step 4: Verify in Browser DevTools
1. Open browser DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Network tab
3. Run a new crawl/fuzz operation
4. Look at the API responses for `/api/evidence` or `/api/fuzz`
5. Check that `metadata.family_probs` is not empty in the responses

### Step 5: Check Backend Logs
If you have access to the backend terminal, look for logs like:
```
Enhanced ML metadata building - chosen_family: sqli
Enhanced ML metadata building - family_probs_dict: {sqli: 1.0}
```

## Expected Results After Fix

### Successful Fix Indicators:
✅ **Ranker Column**: Shows real ML scores instead of "Heuristic"
✅ **ML Type**: Shows "Enhanced ML" for enhanced ML predictions
✅ **family_probs**: Contains actual family probabilities like `{sqli: 1.0}`
✅ **Enhanced ML Detection**: Frontend properly identifies enhanced ML results

### Debugging If Issues Persist:
1. Check if enhanced ML models are loaded in backend
2. Verify the backend is using the fixed `fuzzer_core.py`
3. Check browser console for any JavaScript errors
4. Verify API responses contain non-empty `family_probs`

## Test URLs for Enhanced ML
- `http://testphp.vulnweb.com/artists.php?artist=1` (SQL injection)
- `http://testphp.vulnweb.com/search.php?test=query` (Multiple vulnerabilities)
- Any URL with parameters that could trigger vulnerability detection

## Next Steps
1. Open the frontend at http://localhost:3000
2. Run a test crawl/fuzz operation
3. Verify the Ranker column shows real ML scores
4. If still showing "Heuristic", check backend logs and API responses
